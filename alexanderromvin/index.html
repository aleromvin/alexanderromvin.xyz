<p>Greetings, earthlings! I am Alex, and this is my cool-as-heck (totally serious and professional) website. Here in the homepage you can find the latest updates about myself that I have deemed important enough to be published on this site. If you want to learn more about me, I encourage you to visit the aptly named <a href="/about.html">About Me</a> section. If you want more information about how to get in contact with me or if you want to learn about updates that are not as recent, well... I think you can figure it out on your own!</p>

<ul class="index-excerpts">
    {% assign posts-english = site.posts | where:"language","en" %}
    {% for post in posts-english limit:12 %}
        <li class="fancy-outline-2">
            <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
            <p>{{ post.briefing }}</p>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
